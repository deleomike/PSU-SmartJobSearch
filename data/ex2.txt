EXPERIENCE
Software Engineering Intern
Yahoo! Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, May - August, 2015
• Internedwiththeuserdata team,whichispartofcloudservicesatYahoo!
Research Intern
Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab, TU Darmstadt, Germany, January - June, 2014
• Developed an application (in Java) using the DKPro library to automatically solve multiple choice reading comprehension
questions. Using textsimilarityand textual entailmentmeasures, it obtained the 2nd best scoreintheCLEFEntranceExams
competition.
Research Student
Computer Engineering and Networks Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland, July - December, 2013
• Developed an application (in Python)to use a tree-based learning algorithm to model the deadline hit and miss patterns of
periodic real-time tasks. The algorithm used formal verification techniques to generate a regularlanguage-based guarantee to
predictfuture deadline hits andmisses.
Developer (Google Summer of Code)
Student Developer for National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB), Summer 2012
• Built an app (in Java)forCytoscape, an open-source software for complex networkvisualization. The app helped usersto
visually analyze and modify molecular interaction networks.
PROJECTS
MapReduce Engine
Carnegie Mellon University, Fall 2014
• ImplementedaHadoop-likeMapReduce facility,withmaster andworkernodesformap-reduce operations over large datasets,
with a distributed file system, and fault tolerance to address datanode failures.
Object Recognition Using CIFAR-10 Dataset
Carnegie Mellon University, Fall 2014
• As part of an in-class Kaggle competition,several approaches were tried to train a model using 4000 imagesforthe
CIFAR-10dataset. WithGISTdescriptors andaKernelized (RBF)SVM, a test accuracy of 61% was obtained on a dataset
consisting of 15000 images.
Intelligent Indoor Emergency Response System
Carnegie Mellon University, Spring 2015
• Developed a priority-based auctioning algorithm for task allocation in a multi-agent environment. Using a modified A*
algorithm, tasks were prioritized based on proximity to the location ofthe fire resulting in an efficient evacuation.
